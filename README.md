# tic-tac-toe
This is a tic-tac-toe game I made in October 2021 as a passion project. On October 24, 2021, I found myself coding for almost 8 hours straight, completely engrossed in the project. I found myself submerged in the code and nothing was breaking my focus. It was almost addictive, how you can play a video game for hours and continue to lose track of time.
